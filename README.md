# Langtons-Ant
Langton's Ant image generator that can be run in Google Colab.

## Description
Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior.  
This particular case focuses on Langton's Ant extension to multiple colors.
More about Langton's Ant -> [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)

## Usage
Download ipynb or copy the code and run it in Google Colab.  
Select the input and choose if you want to visualize the Ant's journey.  

ATTENTION! 
The journey's visualization significantly increases the runtime.  
Increase the raised step or disable journey's visualization to boost the speed.

After the journey view the image and select if you want to save.  
Happy experimenting!
